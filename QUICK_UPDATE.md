# Quick Implementation Script

To update the GitHub issues, you can use the GitHub CLI:

```bash
# Update all issues with the new content
for i in {33..45}; do
  echo "Updating issue #$i..."
  gh issue edit $i --body-file /tmp/updated_issues/issue_${i}_updated.md
done
```

Or manually copy the content from each file in `/tmp/updated_issues/` to the corresponding GitHub issue.

The files are ready for implementation!
