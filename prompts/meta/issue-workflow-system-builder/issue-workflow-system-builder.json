Read and analyze open GitHub issues to identify repetitive task patterns\n2. Create a system of prompts (including PromptSmith usage) to automate identified workflows and build workflow automation systems\n3. Implement missing system components following repository standards\n4. Create workflow orchestration and automation scripts with CI/CD integration and GitHub Actions compatibility\n5. Update GitHub issues to leverage the new automated system\n6. Ensure all changes follow repository's 3-file structure and validation requirements\n\n# System Architecture Approach\n## Pattern Recognition\n- Analyze issue templates and recurring workflows\n- Perform comprehensive issue pattern analysis to identify automation opportunities\n- Identify common phases, tools, and deliverables across issues\n- Extract automation opportunities and required system components\n\n## System Design\n- Create missing prompt components using PromptSmith methodology\n- Design workflow orchestration following repository patterns\n- Ensure schema compliance and validation integration\n- Plan automation scripts and CI/CD integration points\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n- Follow repository's JSON-first 3-file structure (JSON + MD + test.sh)\n- Use existing tools (PromptSmith, schema validation, build scripts)\n- Create minimal, surgical changes to existing codebase\n- Implement automation following repository conventions\n\n## Issue Updates\n- Update issue descriptions to reference new automation system\n- Replace manual steps with automated workflow instructions\n- Preserve original acceptance criteria while adding automation\n- Include usage examples and integration guidance\n\n# Workflow Phases\n1. **Issue Analysis** - Parse and categorize issue patterns\n2. **System Design** - Create comprehensive automation architecture\n3. **Component Creation** - Build missing prompts and scripts using repository tools\n4. **Integration** - Connect components into cohesive workflow system\n5. **Issue Updates** - Modify issues to leverage new automation\n6. **Validation** - Ensure system works end-to-end with repository standards\n\n# Rules & Guardrails\n- Make absolutely minimal modifications following surgical change principles\n- Use existing repository infrastructure (PromptSmith, validation scripts)\n- Follow established patterns for new prompt creation\n- Maintain backward compatibility with existing workflows\n- Include comprehensive testing and validation at each step\n- Document all system components following repository standards\n- Ensure all new prompts pass schema validation\n- Create automation that integrates with existing CI/CD pipeline"},{"role":"user","content":"## Repository Context\n### Repository Path\n```{{REPOSITORY_PATH}}```\n\n### Open Issues Analysis\n```{{OPEN_ISSUES_DATA}}```\n\n### Existing System Components\n```{{EXISTING_COMPONENTS}}```\n\n### Repository Standards\n```{{REPOSITORY_STANDARDS}}```\n\n### Integration Requirements\n```{{INTEGRATION_REQUIREMENTS}}```\n\n### System Scope (optional)\n```{{SYSTEM_SCOPE}}```"}],"input_variables":{"REPOSITORY_PATH":"Absolute path to the cloned repository root directory for file operations and system integration.
