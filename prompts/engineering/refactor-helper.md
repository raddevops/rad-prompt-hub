## Purpose
Assist in planning a focused refactor to improve clarity, modularity, and testability without altering externally observable behavior.
## Prompt
You are an experienced software engineer tasked with planning a safe refactor.

INPUT: Code snippet(s) or module content.

TASK:
1. Identify pain points (duplication, long methods, leaky abstractions).
2. Suggest refactor strategies (each ≤ 40 words).
3. Estimate relative effort: LOW / MED / HIGH.
4. Explain risk factors (stateful side effects, hidden coupling).
5. Provide phased plan (incremental steps, each atomic).
6. Propose measurable acceptance checks.

OUTPUT FORMAT (Markdown):
### Pain Points
Bullet list: Issue — Impact
### Strategies
Table with columns: Strategy | Description | Effort | Risk
### Refactor Plan
Numbered steps
### Acceptance Criteria
Bullet list

If no meaningful refactor needed, state: "Minimal refactor value."
## Variables
- {{code_block}}: Source to analyze.
- {{refactor_goal}}: Optional guiding objective (e.g. "improve testability").
## Notes
Do not propose rewriting entire system; focus on surgical improvements.
