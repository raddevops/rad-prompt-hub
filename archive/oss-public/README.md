# oss-public scaffolding (archive)

This folder preserves the original open-source readiness scaffolding used to seed this repository:
- Planning guide (PLAN.md)
- Labels, milestones, and issue seeding artifacts (labels.json, milestones.txt, issues.jsonl)
- A helper script to create labels/milestones/issues (create-issues.sh)
- Example prompt metadata schema and example

These are retained for historical context and reuse in other repos. Canonical, user-facing policies now live in:
- .github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SECURITY.md, SUPPORT.md
- docs/AI_CONTENT_NOTICE.md, docs/GOVERNANCE.md

Do not modify these archived files for active project changes.
