# Security Review Summary

## 🎯 Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

### ✅ pull_request_target Security Hole (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: `pr-labeler.yml` used `pull_request_target` with `pull-requests: write` permissions
**Risk**: Fork PRs could execute malicious code in target repo context  
**Fix**: Changed to `pull_request` trigger - eliminates security vulnerability

### ✅ Supply Chain Attacks (HIGH) 
**Issue**: All GitHub Actions used unpinned versions (@v5, @v6, etc.)
**Risk**: Compromised action updates could inject malicious code
**Fix**: Pinned ALL actions to commit SHAs with version comments

## 🔒 Security Hardening Applied

### Workflow Permissions (Least Privilege)
- Added explicit `permissions` blocks to all workflows
- Removed unnecessary permissions 
- Applied minimal access principle throughout

### Access Controls
- Enhanced CODEOWNERS with comprehensive security-critical file coverage
- Updated branch protection script with stronger requirements
- Added requirement for last push approval on protected branches

### Automated Security Scanning  
- **NEW**: Dependency review workflow for PR vulnerability detection
- Extended CodeQL and secret scanning to run on pull requests
- Enhanced pre-commit hooks with security validation

## 📋 Action Items for Repository Admin

### 1. Apply Branch Protection Settings
```bash
cd tools/
OWNER=raddevops REPO=rad-prompt-hub ./enable-security.sh
```

### 2. Enable Required Status Checks
Ensure these checks are required before merge:
- `validate`
- `Analyze` (CodeQL) 
- `gitleaks`
- `validate-prompts`
- `branch-name-policy` 
- `dependency-review`

### 3. Review Security Settings
Verify at: `https://github.com/raddevops/rad-prompt-hub/settings/security`
- ✅ Secret scanning with push protection
- ✅ Vulnerability alerts
- ✅ Automated security fixes
- ✅ Private vulnerability reporting

## 📊 Security Posture: Before → After

| Risk Area | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Fork PR Security | ❌ pull_request_target vulnerability | ✅ Safe pull_request triggers |
| Supply Chain | ❌ Unpinned actions | ✅ All actions pinned to SHAs |
| Permissions | ⚠️ Implicit permissions | ✅ Explicit least privilege |
| Access Control | ⚠️ Basic CODEOWNERS | ✅ Comprehensive coverage |
| Vulnerability Detection | ⚠️ Limited scanning | ✅ Multi-layer security scanning |

## 🔄 Ongoing Maintenance

- **Quarterly**: Review and update action SHAs using `docs/security-checklist.md`
- **Monthly**: Review CODEOWNERS and access permissions
- **Weekly**: Monitor security advisories and dependency alerts
- **Daily**: Automated security scans via workflows

## 🚨 Emergency Contacts

- **Security Issues**: Use GitHub Security Advisories (private)
- **Immediate Threats**: Contact @raddevops directly  
- **Response SLA**: 72 hours acknowledgment, 7 days initial assessment
